This file is used by the server-side renderer on every page request.
It will render with the context set server-side by req.locals.context.
Since this is a feature, this file is never used in a production environment, and is never published to npm.
The javascript for the application will execute after this initial DOM has been rendered.

The views in this example scaffold use Marionette ItemView, which renders collection data as "items".
In order to use the same partial as the client-side view, put each array context into "items"

<nav>{{> navigation items=navigation}}</nav>

<div id="wrapper">
    <div id="{{id}}">{{> (lookup . 'id') items=(lookup . id)}}</div>
